    \section*{Introduction}
    This report focuses on two sections -- Security and UDP.
    \section*{Security}
    How a public/private key technique, along with encryption in general, could be used to provide a file permission scheme in BitBox?
\\i.e. where users could "own" files/directories that they put into the share directory and provide read/write permission to other users. If you believe there are limitations to such an approach then discuss them. Describe what protocol the BitBox servers should follow to achieve this, including interaction diagrams and message examples. (1125 words)

    \section*{UDP}
    Describe the salient aspects of your UDP implementation, including a critical comparison to the TCP approach. (375 words)
